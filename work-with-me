      <h3>Relevant and Practical Support for staff wellbeing</h3>

      <p>
        Burnout is not a personal failure. Much of the strain we see at work isn’t about individuals.
        It’s about systems that have quietly stretched people beyond what’s sustainable.
      </p>

      <p>
        My work focuses on helping organisations notice this earlier and respond in ways that
        support steadier, healthier ways of working.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work across different settings, adapting the approach to the realities of each environment.
