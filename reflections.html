    <em>A reflection for those who grew up doing the emotional work</em><br>

  <p>There often comes a moment in adulthood when the questions we ask ourselves quietly shift.</p>

  <p>
    It’s no longer:<br>
    “Why does this hurt so much?”<br>
    It becomes:<br>
    “Why am I the only one trying to make this work?”
  </p>

  <p>
    For many of us, family was not overtly cruel. Their words and intentions were present,
    but often slightly misattuned. Birthdays were acknowledged. Holidays were marked.
    The language sounded loving enough.
  </p>

  <p>
    And yet, something was off.<br>
    The care didn’t quite land.<br>
    The warmth didn’t last.<br>
    The closeness came with conditions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Affection existed, but it had rules.<br>
    Connection existed, but it required compliance.<br>
    Care existed, but it did not consistently reach us.
  </p>

  <p>
    So, without fully realising it or having language for it at the time, we learned to adapt.
    We became responsible early. We bridged gaps that were never ours to close.
    We showed up, explained ourselves, softened our needs, corrected our tone,
    and tried again… and again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Still, something essential remained missing.<br>
    Not love.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Attunement.</strong></p>

  <h2 style="color:#056367;">Naming the Actions Without Blame</h2>

  <p>
    Let’s take a moment to name the behaviours we observe. Accountability, emotional attunement,
    capacity, and inclusion hierarchy are often misunderstood, overused, or quietly avoided.
    These are not labels meant to diagnose or blame anyone. They are lenses that help us
    understand why certain relationships continue to hurt, even when love is present.
  </p>

  <p>
    When we don’t have language for these dynamics, we tend to turn the pain inward and assume
    we are asking for too much or expecting something unrealistic. These words matter because
    they help us see the difference between effort and reciprocity, between love and emotional
    availability, and between what we hoped for and what was actually possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    Being able to name the actions gives us permission to hold healthier boundaries. It allows
    us to be kinder to ourselves when family members cannot do for us what we wish they could.
    With this understanding, we no longer have to blame ourselves or question our worth.
    Instead, we can recognise that people often do what they do because their capacity is limited.
  </p>

  <h2 style="color:#056367;">What Is Emotional Attunement?</h2>

  <p>Attunement is being understood, not just acknowledged.</p>

  <p>
    It’s when someone notices your emotional state and responds with care rather than correction,
    defensiveness, or silence. It’s the difference between hearing words and feeling met.
    Without attunement, you can be physically present in a family and still feel invisible.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many people I work with describe it this way:<br>
    “They weren’t absent… but I always felt alone.”
  </p>

  <p>
    They may have listened to you, but they did not truly hear or feel you. You may have been
    included, but not deeply considered. Your needs weren’t dramatic. You weren’t too much.
    They simply did not have the capacity to meet your needs.
  </p>

  <h2 style="color:#056367;">Repair After Rupture</h2>

  <p>
    Every family disagrees. There will inevitably be moments when you cannot see eye to eye.
    What determines emotional safety is not the absence of rupture, but the presence of repair.
    In healthy relationships, conflict is followed by making amends.
  </p>

  <p>
    In dysfunctional systems, rupture becomes punishment. Silence replaces dialogue.
    Time passes, but nothing is resolved. The most emotionally aware person becomes responsible
    for restoring peace.
  </p>

  <p>
    Over time, this teaches a painful lesson:<br>
    “If I speak up, I will lose connection.”
  </p>

  <p>
    One woman once shared, “I learned it was safer to apologise for my feelings than to wait
    for anyone else to acknowledge them.”
  </p>

  <p>
    In healthy relationships, repair sounds like:<br>
    “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said that.”<br>
    “I was defensive. Can we talk?”<br>
    “I see how that hurt you.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Without repair, the emotionally attuned person becomes the emotional janitor,
    constantly cleaning up messes they didn’t make.
  </p>

  <h2 style="color:#056367;">Accountability</h2>

  <p>
    Today, accountability is often used as a buzzword — something that sounds mature but is
    rarely practiced with depth. At its core, accountability is the ability to say,
    “My behaviour impacted you, even if I didn’t intend it.”
  </p>

  <p>
    When accountability is absent, harm is explained away, minimised, or reframed as sensitivity.
    The burden shifts to the injured party to understand, let it go, or be the bigger person.
  </p>

  <p>
    Families without attunement often interpret boundaries as rejection and emotion as threat.
    So when a parent calmly protects their child, or an adult child speaks up respectfully,
    it isn’t heard as care. It is perceived as insubordination.
  </p>

  <h2 style="color:#056367;">Inclusion Without Hierarchy</h2>

  <p>
    Some families operate with invisible rankings — primary children and secondary ones,
    insiders and outsiders, those who belong effortlessly and those who must earn their place.
  </p>

  <p>
    This often shows up in blended families, where children from previous relationships quietly
    feel displaced. The children shared within the household sit higher in the hierarchy,
    while others learn to stay small, grateful, or quiet.
  </p>

  <p>
    Healthy families include without ranking. No child is more legitimate than another.
    No adult child has to earn access through obedience. No spouse erases previous children,
    and grandchildren are welcomed equally.
  </p>

  <p>
    When inclusion is conditional, belonging becomes unstable, and the child who senses this
    often grows into the adult who questions their worth.
  </p>

  <h2 style="color:#056367;">Capacity</h2>

  <p>The truth is, capacity is not love.</p>

  <p>
    People can love you and still lack the capacity to self-reflect, repair after conflict,
    include you fully, or remain emotionally attuned.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your loved ones may care in the ways they know how, but they may not have the emotional
    infrastructure required for the kind of relationship you keep offering.
  </p>

  <p>That mismatch creates chronic grief.</p>

  <p>
    Capacity helps answer a grounding question:<br>
    “What are they realistically able to give, consistently, without me shrinking?”
  </p>

  <p>
    The pain does not come from malice.<br>
    It comes from mismatch.
  </p>

  <h2 style="color:#056367;">Closing Words</h2>

  <p>
    The first truth I want you to hold is this: you were not asking for too much.
    You often offered mature emotional connection in systems that did not have the capacity
    to honour it. They never learned how to meet you where you are.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is ambiguous grief — grieving people who are still alive but unavailable in the ways
    that matter.
  </p>

  <p>
    Mourn without self-blame. Allow anger without judging yourself. Grieve what never was,
    not just what ended. Release the fantasy that one more explanation will change them.
    It won’t. Patterns do not lie.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you have done all you can do, it is not your fault.
  </p>

  <p>
    And while this realisation can feel lonely at first, it is also the doorway to something new.
    You can build relationships rooted in mutual care and reciprocity.
    You can belong without betraying yourself, belittling your standards,
    or performing just to keep connection.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is not the end of family.<br>
    It is the end of carrying the weight alone.
  </p>
