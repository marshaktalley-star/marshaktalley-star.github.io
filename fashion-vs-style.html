    <h2>Fashion vs Style: What's the Difference?</h2>

    <p>
      We often use the terms "fashion" and "style" interchangeably regarding our clothing choices. However, it's important to note that these two concepts are different. By understanding the difference between fashion and style, we can develop our own unique sense of style and make more intentional fashion choices.
    </p>

    <h3>What is fashion?</h3>

    <p>
      Fashion is a constantly changing industry that produces and markets clothing, accessories, and beauty products. Trends, designers, and cultural movements influence it. Fashion is about keeping up with the latest styles and trends and often involves buying new clothes to stay current or up-to-date.

    <h3>What is style?</h3>

    <p>
      Style, on the other hand, is a more personal and enduring concept. Your individual style reflects your personality, values, and preferences. It is about how you put together your clothing and accessories to create a cohesive and unique look that is all your own. Style is not about following trends; rather, it is about finding what works for you and sticking with it.
    </p>

    <p>
      While fashion and style are different concepts, they are not mutually exclusive. You can use fashion as a tool to express your unique style, but it's essential to do so in a way that is authentic to yourself. Below are a few tips for incorporating fashion into your personal style:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Choose pieces that reflect who you are.</strong> This step demands that you know your personality, preferences, and lifestyle...</li>
      <li><strong>Try new things and step out of your comfort zone.</strong> Experiment with different clothing combinations...</li>
      <li><strong>Invest in quality pieces that last for years.</strong> Quality clothing saves money over time...</li>
      <li><strong>Be confident!</strong> Style is all about confidence...</li>
    </ul>

        Fashion is what you buy. Style is how you wear it!
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>
      Fashion and style are subjective and personal choices. It's okay to take risks and enjoy experimenting with your clothing choices. Understanding the distinction between fashion and style can help you cultivate a distinct and personalised sense of style that is truly unique to you.
