    Silhouette’s Café
  </h3>

  <p>
    Before formalising my work in preventive health and wellbeing, I founded 
    <strong>Silhouette’s Café</strong>, formerly <em>Silhouette’s Health Café</em>, a wellness-focused business rooted in accessibility, education, and everyday care.
  </p>

  <p>
    Silhouette’s Café offered 100% certified essential oils, herbs, diffusers, herbal coffees and teas, and thoughtfully curated wellness products designed to support emotional balance, stress reduction, and intentional living. For a period of time, I also operated a physical storefront in Dallas, Texas, creating a space where conversations about wellbeing were practical, human, and grounded, not clinical or performative.
  </p>

  <p>
    What began as a product-based wellness business evolved into something deeper:
    an understanding that <strong>prevention lives in daily choices, environments, and rhythms</strong>, not just programmes or policies.
  </p>

  <p>
    While Silhouette’s Café currently lives quietly within my wider work, it remains deeply relevant to my preventive wellbeing practice. It reflects the same values I bring to organisations and individuals today: sustainability, nervous system awareness, emotional literacy, and care that fits real life.
  </p>

  <p>
    Silhouette’s Café will be returning in its next iteration, integrated, intentional, and aligned with the broader <em>Live Inspired</em> philosophy.

    Wellbeing Is Also About Where We Land
  </h3>

  <p>
    My work in preventive health and wellbeing also recognises something often overlooked:
    <strong>our environments matter</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alongside my consulting and coaching work, I manage a small portfolio of furnished rental homes, spaces designed to offer comfort, calm, and stability during periods of transition. Whether supporting professionals on temporary placements or individuals needing a fully furnished, ready-to-live-in environment, this work reflects the same principles I bring to wellbeing: safety, intentionality, and ease.
  </p>

  <p>
    While this is not a public-facing service, I believe in transparency and alignment. The way we live, rest, and recover is inseparable from our health, and I strive to ensure that every part of my work reflects that understanding.

        <p style="margin:0 0 14px;font-size:clamp(16px,3.8vw,18px);line-height:1.65;">
          My work did not begin in theory.
          It was shaped through personal experience,
          where I came to understand how prolonged stress and emotional strain
          quietly reshape identity, confidence, and purpose.
        </p>

        <p style="margin:0 0 14px;font-size:clamp(16px,3.8vw,18px);line-height:1.65;">
          That understanding led me to focus on prevention rather than recovery alone.
        </p>

        <p style="margin:0 0 14px;font-size:clamp(16px,3.8vw,18px);line-height:1.65;">
          Alongside my consultancy and wellbeing work, I am the author of
          <strong style="color:#056367;">The Decision Is Just the Beginning</strong>

          exploring agency, emotional awareness, and sustainable personal change.

        <p style="margin:0 0 22px;font-size:clamp(16px,3.8vw,18px);line-height:1.65;">
          I have spent over two decades in education, teaching and supporting people
          with diverse learning profiles and special educational needs,

          My work spans both coaching and consulting.

          used intentionally depending on context and responsibility.

        <p style="margin:0 0 10px;font-size:clamp(15px,3.4vw,17px);line-height:1.65;">
          This work is not therapy, counselling, or clinical intervention.
          It does not involve diagnosis or treatment of mental health conditions.

        <p style="margin:0;font-size:clamp(15px,3.4vw,17px);line-height:1.65;">
          Preventive wellbeing support focuses on awareness, steadiness,
          and practical strategies that sit alongside existing
          therapeutic or safeguarding support where needed.

      <div class="book-page active">
        <h2>Chapter One</h2>
        <h3>Where It Began</h3>
        <p>
          My work has always centred on people — their stories, their resilience, and their capacity
          to grow even in difficult circumstances. For over two decades, I worked across education,
          special educational needs, and employability, supporting individuals navigating sustained
          stress, disruption, and transition.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="book-page">
        <h2>Chapter Two</h2>
        <h3>The Work Beneath the Work</h3>
        <p>
          Long before I used the language of preventive health, I was already doing the work.
          Supporting learners experiencing burnout, anxiety, disengagement, trauma, and overwhelm
          required more than curriculum delivery — it required emotional awareness, regulation,
          trust-building, and practical strategies for wellbeing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether working with young people, adults returning to learning, or professionals at risk
          of burnout, my approach has always been holistic, compassionate, and strengths-based.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="book-page">
        <h2>Chapter Three</h2>
        <h3>Patterns I Couldn’t Ignore</h3>
        <p>
          Over time, a clear pattern emerged: burnout was not a failure of effort, but a signal.
          A signal that systems, environments, and expectations were misaligned with human needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          I saw capable, committed people struggling not because they lacked ability, but because
          they lacked sustainable support.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="book-page">
        <h2>Chapter Four</h2>
        <h3>Preventive Health &amp; Wellbeing</h3>
        <p>
          My work in Preventive Health and Wellbeing grew directly from this foundation.
          It is not a departure from my past — it is the natural continuation of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, I support individuals and organisations experiencing sustained stress with
          practical, preventive guidance that restores balance, clarity, and capacity —
          before crisis becomes the only option.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="book-page">
        <h2>Chapter Five</h2>
        <h3>Live Inspired</h3>
        <p>
          Live Inspired is both my philosophy and my practice.
          I believe pain is not the end of the story — it is the raw material.
          Possibility is the quiet catalyst.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work exists to help people reconnect with their energy, their agency,
          and their sense of what is possible.
